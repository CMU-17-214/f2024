\section*{Trouble Rules:}

2-4 players are trying to move their pieces from their home to their finish
zone. Players roll a D6 and move their pieces clockwise, rolling a 6 lets them
roll again. To exit their home zone, they must roll a 6 and move a piece from
their home to their start position. Landing on an opponent's piece sends it back
to the opponent's home zone. Players may not have two of their pieces in the
same position. Exact rolls are required when moving to the finish zone. The
first player to have all of their pieces in their own finish zone is the winner.
